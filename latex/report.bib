abstract = {The 15 January 2022 Hunga, Tonga, volcano's explosive eruption produced the most powerful blast recorded in the last century, with an estimated equivalent TNT yield of 100–200 megatons. The blast energy was propagated through the atmosphere as various wave types. The most prominent wave was a long-period (>2000 s) surface-guided Lamb wave with energy comparable to that of the 1883 Krakatoa Lamb wave; both were clearly observed by pressure sensors (barometers) worldwide. Internal gravity, acoustic-gravity, and infrasound waves were captured in great detail by the entire infrasound component of the International Monitoring System (IMS). For instance, infrasound waves (<300 s period) were seen to circumnavigate Earth up to eight times. Atmospheric waves captured by the IMS infrasound network and selected barometers near the source provide insight on Earth's impulse response at planetary scales.}
